    "Euler's method computes ODE's by using tangent line approximations. Essentially, a tangent line is created using the initial condition and a step of size $\\Delta t$ is taken along that line to compute the next tangent line. This continues until the entire curve has been approximated. Obviously, a smaller $\\Delta t$ step is going to yield a better approximation of the curve. Also, this method won't yield a very accurate approximation for rapidly changing functions because the tangent lines would change too quickly. This method is best used with a slow-changing function.\n",

    "The midpoint method also computes ODE's using tangent line approximations. However, this method differs from Euler's method in that it computes the tangent line at the midpoint of two points. The tangent line at the midpoint generally gives a more accurate approximation of the curve in that interval. To find $u_1$, one would use Euler's method because $u_{-1}$ does not exist.\n",

    "Euler’s method is used as a foundation for Heun’s method. When extremely small steps sizes are used for Euler’s method, over large number of steps error begins to accumulate and the estimate diverges from the actual functional value. Heun;s method addresses this issue by considering the interval spanned by the tangent line as a whole. Heun’s Method considers the tangent lines to the solution curve at both ends of the interval, one which overestimates, and one which underestimates the ideal vertical coordinates. If this slope is passed through the left end point of the interval, the result is evidently too steep to be used as an ideal prediction line and overestimates the ideal point. Therefore, the ideal point lies approximately halfway between the erroneous overestimation and underestimation, the average of the two slopes.\n",

    "The 4th order Runge-Kutta method takes 4 slopes at two points and then takes a weighted average of those slopes to compute an approximate slope for a point. The first slope is the slope at the initial condition. This slope is used to approximated a value at the midpoint. This computed value is then used to find the second slope. This second slope gives a second approximation at that midpoint. The third slope is found by using the second slope's approximation of the midpoint to compute a slope at the last endpoint. That third slope is then used to compute an approximate value for the endpoint. That approximate value is used to find the fourth slope. The midpoint slopes are weighted twice that of the slopes approximated by endpoints. The midpoint slopes are weighted more because they are generally more accurate than using the endpoints to approximate slopes."
